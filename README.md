# Tanki Fund Tracker, v3

App made to track the Tanki Fund. Visualizations made with Plotly and displayed with Streamlit, deployed on Heroku.

Subject to change back to Flask + Plotly whenever I figure out how to configure that better; this does allow me to not worry about UI (especially the metric stuff), but I think it could be more personalized.

## To Do
- More Analytics
- Time Series Analysis
- Regressions/Trendlines
